## How to Use
To use this library, follow these steps:
1. Include the library header in your project.
2. Implement your custom brownout handler function.
3. Instantiate the `ESP32_Custom_Brownout_Fn` with your handler function.

Here's a quick start example:

```cpp
#include "ESP32_Custom_Brownout_Handler.h"
#include "esp_attr.h"

// Your custom handler function
void IRAM_ATTR custom_brownout_handler() {
    // Handle brownout event here
}

void setup() {
    // Instantiate the custom brownout handler
    ESP32_Custom_Brownout_Fn(custom_brownout_handler);
}

void loop() {
    // Main code loop
}
```
